
## **Project Title**
**EduCuration**: Earn Tokens by Curating Educational Content

## **Project Description**
EduCuration is a decentralized platform that allows users to create, submit, vote on, and curate educational content. The platform rewards both **content creators** and **curators** (voters) with **EduTokens**, an ERC-20 token. Content creators can submit educational videos, articles, or tutorials, while curators can vote on the content to validate its quality. Both content creators and curators are incentivized for their participation through token rewards.

EduCuration is built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and fairness in content submission, voting, and reward distribution.

## **Contract Address**
0x8C100f2202D0B34dd27ae62Db255f8843d8dE762



## **Project Vision**
EduCuration's vision is to build a global decentralized educational ecosystem where creators are rewarded for their contributions and curators help ensure high-quality content. We aim to make educational resources accessible to anyone, anywhere, while ensuring fair compensation for those who create and curate content. 

By leveraging blockchain technology, EduCuration ensures that the platform is transparent, fair, and resistant to censorship, creating a thriving community of learners and educators.

## **Key Features**
1. **Content Submission**:
   - Users can submit educational content such as tutorials, lectures, and articles.
   - Each content submission is linked to the creatorâ€™s wallet address, ensuring authenticity.

2. **Voting System**:
   - Users can vote on content (upvote or downvote).
   - The voting mechanism helps curate high-quality educational content.

3. **Reward System**:
   - **Content Creators**: Creators are rewarded with **EduTokens** for content that receives upvotes. The more upvotes their content receives, the higher their reward.
   - **Curators (Voters)**: Voters earn **EduTokens** for every vote they cast. A reward is given for both upvotes and downvotes (e.g., 10 EDU tokens per vote).
   - **Content Finalization**: Once content receives a certain number of votes, the creator can finalize the content and claim a reward.

4. **Transparency and Security**:
   - All interactions, including content submissions, voting, and rewards, are recorded on the blockchain.
   - The platform is decentralized, ensuring that no single entity controls the content or voting process.

5. **ERC-20 Token (EduToken)**:
   - **EduToken** is the native token used for rewards. It is an ERC-20 token and can be transferred or used for various activities within the platform.

6. **Decentralized Platform**:
   - The platform is fully decentralized, meaning that it does not rely on a central authority. Content creation, voting, and reward distribution are governed by smart contracts.

7. **Content Finalization**:
   - Creators can finalize their content once it has received enough votes, ensuring that only high-quality content is rewarded.
   
## **Future Enhancements**
- **Decentralized Governance**: Implement a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) to give the community a say in platform decisions (e.g., reward structure, content guidelines).
- **IPFS Integration**: Store content such as videos and articles on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized content hosting.
- **Staking Mechanism**: Introduce staking where users can stake **EduTokens** to gain voting power or earn additional rewards.
